  <h1>A Quick Guide to Get Started with JavaScript Classes</h1>
  <h3>What is a <em>class</em>?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Classes were added to JavaScript in
      <strong>ES6 specification </strong>(<em>ECMAScript 2015)</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Classes are not a new feature per se. Classes basically provide a
      different way to create objects and work with prototypes and inheritance.
      This is also why many JavaScript developers call classes a
      <mark>syntactic sugar</mark>.
    </li>
    <li>Every class starts with '<em>class</em>' keyword</li>
    <li>
      The convention is to write a name of the class startting with a capital
      letter
    </li>
    <li>While declaring a class no parentheses and parameters are required.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Classes and Constructor</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Classes don't support parameters, but still you can specify parameters for
      your class in the method called <mark>constructor</mark>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Constructor</em> is a unique method that is created inside a class and
      only once.
    </li>
    <li>
      The constructor executes tasks you have specified when you create a new
      instance of a class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instance is a new object based on a specific class, and it inherits all
      properties and methods defined in that class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every time you create new instance of a class it will also automatically
      invoke the constructor method.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you specify some parameters for the constructor method these parameters
      will become parameters of the class itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      While creating new instance of the class, you can pass in some values as
      arguments, based on the parameters of the constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      The '<em>this</em>' keyword inside a class refers to the class itself.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Class Properties and Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A class can have infinite number of properties, just like any object.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can define properties for the class and assign thier values only
      inside the constructor method.
    </li>
    <li>
      Alternatively, you can specify class fields( same as properties) outside
      of constructor but inside of class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Three types of class fields: <strong>public, static</strong> and
      <strong>private</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Class methods are defined inside the class body but outside of
      constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Defining class methods is as simple as a function. Only the difference is:
      a class method is defined without a '<em>function</em>' and
      '<em>this</em>' keywords.
    </li>
    <li>
      However, if you want to reference some property or method of the class you
      are working with, you need '<em>this</em>' keywrod.
    </li>
    <li>
      To call the method on the new instance that you have created, use
      <em>dot</em> notation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Public class fields and methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      '<em>Class properties</em>' and '<em>public class field</em>' are very
      similar.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        Differences between '<em>Class properties</em>' and '<em
          >public class field</em
        >':
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Class properties</em> are defined in the constructor method.
        </li>
        <li><em>Class fields</em> are defined outside of constructor.</li>
        <li>
          But we still need to use constructor, if you want to define class
          parameters or do some stuff during class intantiation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em>public fields</em> don't use '<em>this</em>' keyword. To
          define new <em>public fields</em>, we start with the name of the
          field(property), not the '<em>this</em>' and <em>dot</em> notation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Public fields are always accessible from the inside as well as outside
          of the class, and its instances.
        </li>
        <li>
          That means, we can access and modify the public fields. And we can do
          the same for public methods as well.
        </li>
        <li>Any class field and method defined are public by default</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Static class fields and methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We define a <em>static class field</em> or <em>method</em> by adding the
      keyword '<em>static</em>' befor the field or method name.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unlike <em>public class fields</em>, we can't access
      <em>static class fields</em> on instances of the class.
    </li>
    <li>
      We can access <em>static class fields</em> only on the class itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      The same applies to <em>static methods</em> as well. We can't call them on
      instances of the class. But we call them only on the class itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Static fields</em> and <em>methods</em> are often used for
      <strong>utility purposes</strong>. For example, doing cleanups, updates or
      having an evidence of existing class instances.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Only</strong> <em>static methods</em> can work with
      <em>static class fields</em>. We can't access
      <em>static class fields</em> with neither <em>public</em> nor
      <em>private methods</em>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Private Class Fields and Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You can work with fields or methods defined as private only inside the
      class.
    </li>
    <li>From the outside, private field and methods are invisible.</li>
    <li>
      We start the name with #(hashtag symbol) in order to define private field
      or method.
    </li>
    <li>
      This can be useful to keep some data private. Such data are inaccessible
      from the outside and also from any class instance.
    </li>
    <li>
      To access private field or cal private method, you have to use the
      #hashtag symbol.
    </li>
    <li>Public method can access private fields and methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Classes and Instances</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instances are like new objects you create based on existing classes. The
      reason for creating new instances is that they automatically inherit
      properties and methods you defined in the class they are based on.
    </li>
    <li>
      Therefore, you don't have to write the same code over and over again if
      you want to use it in multiple objects. You just need to create one class
      and put the code you want to re-use there. When you need an object that
      can do all that stuff you can use that class to create new instance.
    </li>
    <li>
      The instance will inherit properties and methods you defined in that
      'parent' class.
    </li>
    <li>
      In order to create new instance of class, declare a new variable and
      assign with 'new' keyword followed by the name of the class you want to
      instantiate and parentheses. If the class accepts any parameters, you pass
      them inside the parentheses that follow after the name of the class,
      otherwise leave parentheses empty.
    </li>
    <li>
      This way you can create as many instances of a specific class as you want.
    </li>
    <li>
      All properties and their values you 'hard-code' in the constructor of a
      specific class will be inherited by all instances of that class. Any
      properties you assign values passed as arguments will be dynamic. They
      will depend on arguments you use during instantiation.
    </li>
  </ul>
