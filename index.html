  <h1>A Quick Guide to Get Started with JavaScript Classes</h1>
  <h3>What is a <em>class</em>?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Classes were added to JavaScript in
      <strong>ES6 specification </strong>(<em>ECMAScript 2015)</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Classes are not a new feature per se. Classes basically provide a
      different way to create objects and work with prototypes and inheritance.
      This is also why many JavaScript developers call classes a
      <mark>syntactic sugar</mark>.
    </li>
    <li>Every class starts with '<em>class</em>' keyword</li>
    <li>
      The convention is to write a name of the class startting with a capital
      letter
    </li>
    <li>While declaring a class no parentheses and parameters are required.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Classes and Constructor</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Classes don't support parameters, but still you can specify parameters for
      your class in the method called <mark>constructor</mark>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Constructor</em> is a unique method that is created inside a class and
      only once.
    </li>
    <li>
      The constructor executes tasks you have specified when you create a new
      instance of a class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instance is a new object based on a specific class, and it inherits all
      properties and methods defined in that class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every time you create new instance of a class it will also automatically
      invoke the constructor method.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you specify some parameters for the constructor method these parameters
      will become parameters of the class itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      While creating new instance of the class, you can pass in some values as
      arguments, based on the parameters of the constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      The '<em>this</em>' keyword inside a class refers to the class itself.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Class Properties and Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A class can have infinite number of properties, just like any object.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can define properties for the class and assign thier values only
      inside the constructor method.
    </li>
    <li>
      Alternatively, you can specify class fields( same as properties) outside
      of constructor but inside of class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Three types of class fields: <strong>public, static</strong> and
      <strong>private</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Class methods are defined inside the class body but outside of constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Defining class methods is as simple as a function. Only the difference is:
      a class method is defined without a '<em>function</em>' and
      '<em>this</em>' keywords.
    </li>
    <li>
      However, if you want to reference some property or method of the class you
      are working with, you need '<em>this</em>' keywrod.
    </li>
    <li>
      To call the method on the new instance that you have created, use
      <em>dot</em> notation.
    </li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
